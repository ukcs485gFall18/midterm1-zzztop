# MOON RUNNER

Original Functionality
MoonRunner uses CoreLocation to track the user’s route, shows a map during their run with a constantly updating line marking their path, reports their average pace as they run, awards badges for running various distances, and shows a map of their route when they’re finished.

Added Functionalities
1)Table view to display the past runs saved in core data. 
2)Cumulative Stats Board for all past runs
3)Tips button that takes you to view controller where you can choose the tip category (Speed or Distance). Each button will take you to another view controller that displays nine tips for the selected category. When you press on a tip, a longer description of the tip is revealed.

***Please note that the application runs are simulated using 'City Run' provided by XCode so that the use feels like they are running through Cupertino. According to the app tutorial, this is achieved by doing the following: "before pressing the New Run button, select Debug\Location\City Run from the Simulator menu."***
