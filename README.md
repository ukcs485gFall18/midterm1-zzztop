# MOON RUNNER

Jordan George
- I worked on the PastRunViewController. I set it up and worked on getting the table view to display the past runs saved in core data. 

Kyra Seevers
- New Functionality: I added to the Past Runs functionality by adding a Cumulative Stats Board for all past runs. This was implemented in the PastRunsViewController as a header cell for the UITableView. In order to customize the header cell, I also implemented the StatsHeaderCellTableViewCell class, and added the necessary storyboard changes for correct viewing.
- I also completed Part 1 of the tutorial.
