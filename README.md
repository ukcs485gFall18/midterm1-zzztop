# MOON RUNNER

Jordan George
- I worked on the PastRunViewController. I set it up and worked on getting the table view to display the past runs saved in core data.

- New Functionality: I added to the Past Runs functionality by adding a Cumulative Stats Board for all past runs. This was implemented in the PastRunsViewController as a header cell for the UITableView. In order to customize the header cell, I also implemented the StatsHeaderCellTableViewCell class, and added the necessary storyboard changes for correct viewing.
- I also completed Part 1 of the tutorial.

3)longerTips - 9 tips on how to run for longer, same functionality
- I also completed Part 2 of the tutorial

***Please note that the application runs are simulated using 'City Run' provided by XCode so that the use feels like they are running through Cupertino. According to the app tutorial, this is achieved by doing the following: "before pressing the New Run button, select Debug\Location\City Run from the Simulator menu." ***
